# Design Pattern: Observer Pattern

## Overview

Software design patterns are programming paradigms that describe reusable solutions to common design problems. They are not code snippets but templates for solving recurring issues in software design. While they are not a substitute for sound software design principles, they provide a solid starting point for designing and documenting software. Design patterns also facilitate effective communication of design decisions among developers.

In this project, we demonstrate the Observer design pattern. The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables the implementation of a subscription mechanism for notifying interested clients about events related to an observed object. It provides a means to subscribe to and unsubscribe from these events for objects that adhere to a subscriber interface. The Observer pattern is also referred to as the Publish-Subscribe pattern.

## Real-World Applications

The Observer pattern finds its application in various real-world scenarios, including:

1. **GUI Applications:** It is used to notify the graphical user interface (GUI) of changes in the underlying data model, ensuring that the interface stays synchronized with the data.

2. **Distributed Systems:** In applications involving distributed systems, the Observer pattern allows clients to be notified of changes in the underlying data model, ensuring data consistency across distributed components.

3. **Event-Driven Programming:** The Observer pattern is widely used in event-driven programming, where it enables the notification of subscribers about events, such as user interactions, system events, or custom events.

By employing the Observer pattern, these applications achieve better decoupling, maintainability, and flexibility in managing and responding to changes.
